# DSL-Age-Estimation

As the final assignment for _Datascience: lab and methods_, we were required to create a regression pipeline to estimate the age of a target from different features extracted from its vocal recording. We were provided with an initial dataset, comprising of both categorical and numerical features related to the audio recording itself and gender, nationality of the target. More over, we implemented a data extraction pipeline to retrieve many features from the recordings, after applying some cleaning processes.
